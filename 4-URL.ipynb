    "## URL dispatcher:\n",
    "\n",
    "A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web application.\n",
    "Django lets you design URLs however you want, with no framework limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no .php or .cgi required, and certainly none of that 0,2097,1-1-1928,00 nonsense.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Cool URIs don’t change, by World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee,\n",
    "for excellent arguments on why URLs should be clean and usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module informally called a URLconf (URL configuration).\n",
    "This module is pure Python code and is a simple mapping between URL patterns (simple regular expressions) to Python functions (your views).\n",
    "\n",
    "This mapping can be as short or as long as needed.\n",
    "It can reference other mappings. And, because it’s pure Python code, it can be constructed dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Django processes a request:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user requests a page from your Django-powered site,\n",
    "this is the algorithm the system follows to determine which Python code to execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Django determines the root URLconf module to use. Ordinarily, this is the value of the ROOT_URLCONF setting, but if the incoming HttpRequest object has a urlconf attribute (set by middleware), its value will be used in place of the ROOT_URLCONF setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Django loads that Python module and looks for the variable urlpatterns. This should be a Python list of django.conf.urls.url() instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Django runs through each URL pattern, in order, and stops at the first one that matches the requested URL.\n",
    "4. Once one of the regexes matches, Django imports and calls the given view, which is a simple Python function (or a class-based view). The view gets passed the following arguments:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > An instance of HttpRequest.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > If the matched regular expression returned no named groups, then the matches from the regular expression are provided as positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > The keyword arguments are made up of any named groups matched by the regular expression, overridden by any arguments specified in the optional kwargs argument to django.conf.urls.url().\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If no regex matches, or if an exception is raised during any point in this process, Django invokes an appropriate error-handling view. See Error handling below.\n",

    "The 'r' in front of each regular expression string is optional but recommended.\n",
    "It tells Python that a string is “raw” – that nothing in the string should be escaped. See Dive Into Python’s explanation.\n",
    "Example requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A request to /articles/2005/03/ would match the third entry in the list. Django would call the function views.month_archive(request, '2005', '03').\n",

    ">/articles/2005/3/ would not match any URL patterns, because the third entry in the list requires two digits for the month.\n",
    "\n",
    ">/articles/2003/ would match the first pattern in the list, not the second one, because the patterns are tested in order, and the first one is the first test to pass. Feel free to exploit the ordering to insert special cases like this. Here, Django would call the function views.special_case_2003(request)\n",
    "\n",
    ">/articles/2003 would not match any of these patterns, because each pattern requires that the URL end with a slash.\n",
    "\n",
    ">/articles/2003/03/03/ would match the final pattern. Django would call the function views.article_detail(request, '2003', '03', '03').\n",
    "\n",
    "## Named groups:\n",
    "The above example used simple, non-named regular-expression groups (via parenthesis) to capture bits of the URL and pass them as positional arguments to a view.\n",
    "In more advanced usage, it’s possible to use named regular-expression groups to capture URL bits and pass them as keyword arguments to a view.\n",
    "In Python regular expressions, the syntax for named regular-expression groups is (?P<name>pattern), where name is the name of the group and pattern is some pattern to match.\n",

    "## URL namespaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "URL namespaces allow you to uniquely reverse named URL patterns even if different applications use the same URL names.\n",
    "It’s a good practice for third-party apps to always use namespaced URLs (as we did in the tutorial).\n",
    "Similarly, it also allows you to reverse URLs if multiple instances of an application are deployed.\n",
    "In other words, since multiple instances of a single application will share named URLs, namespaces provide a way to tell these named URLs apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django applications that make proper use of URL namespacing can be deployed more than once for a particular site.\n",
    "For example django.contrib.admin has an AdminSite class which allows you to easily deploy more than one instance of the admin.\n",
    "In a later example, we’ll discuss the idea of deploying the polls application from the tutorial in two different locations\n",
    "so we can serve the same functionality to two different audiences (authors and publishers).\n",
    "\n",
    "A URL namespace comes in two parts, both of which are strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "application namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "> This describes the name of the application that is being deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every instance of a single application will have the same application namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, Django’s admin application has the somewhat predictable application namespace of 'admin'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## instance namespace\n",
    "This identifies a specific instance of an application.\n",
    "Instance namespaces should be unique across your entire project.\n",
    "However, an instance namespace can be the same as the application namespace.\n",
    "This is used to specify a default instance of an application.\n",
    "For example, the default Django admin instance has an instance namespace of 'admin'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Namespaced URLs are specified using the ':' operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the main index page of the admin application is referenced using\n",
    "\n",
    ">'admin:index'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates a namespace of 'admin', and a named URL of 'index'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Namespaces can also be nested.\n",
    "The named URL 'sports:polls:index' would look for a pattern named 'index' in the namespace 'polls'\n",
    "that is itself defined within the top-level namespace 'sports'.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL namespaces and included URLconfs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Application namespaces of included URLconfs can be specified in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you can set an app_name attribute in the included URLconf module, at the same level as the urlpatterns attribute.\n",
    "You have to pass the actual module, or a string reference to the module, to include(), not the list of urlpatterns itselfself."
